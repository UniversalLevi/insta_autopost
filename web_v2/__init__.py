"""
Placeholder package for InstaForge V2 web layer.

All new V2 web/API code should live under this package to keep it
isolated from the existing production system.
"""

# Note: Routers are intentionally not auto-mounted here.
# They can be mounted by a future V2 FastAPI app or a dedicated gateway:
# - web_v2.auth_routes.router
# - web_v2.meta_routes.router
